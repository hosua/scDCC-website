1) Where do I get .txt file HumanLiver_marker_ZIFA.txt (I will need to be able to generate them for all kinds of data sets)
2) What is the output? Input is .h5 file, is output latent.txt?
3) Who can I talk to about Lochness, or where can I learn about it?

* If there is no .h5 data  or there is no name of gene, do not allow user to submit form.
* number of constraints
* Cutoff for ML
* Cutoff for CL

* There will be two output files:
	- latent_p0_1.txt
	- pred_y_latent_p0_1.txt
